                    <h2 class="section-heading">What is the relationship between negative and positive gram staining and the MIC for Penicillin?</h2>
                    
                    <div id="graph-gramStain"></div>

                    <p>My process for determining how I should visually represent the relationship between negative and positive gram staining and the MIC for Penicillin started by considering the dramatic difference in MIC values for Penicillin. Some values for MIC got up to 870 for certain bacteria types, while the lowest values were less than 1. I took some time to look at the data, and realized that generally, the bacteria that had negative gram staining tended to have higher MIC values compared to positive gram staining bacteria.</p>             

                    <p>Thus, I decided to create two graphs along non-aligned axis. This allowed me to have two different scales which helps convey the difference in values better. As an extra precaution, I also included lables above each data point representing the literal MIC value. For the graph with bacteria types that have negative gram staining, I used the color red to encode for the negative value as red is typically associated with negativity. In that same vein, for the graph with bacteria types that have positive gram staining, I used green to encode the positive values as green is typically associated with positivity.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, I chose to include a line on each graph which shows where the MIC value of 1 is. This not only draws attention to the difference in scales, making it harder for people to misread the data, but it also serves as a common reference point between the two graphs. Lastly, I chose to angle the labels of the bacteria directly down as to make it very clear which data point they are each connected to.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What is the relationship between the gram staining property and MIC of Streptomycin for different types of bacteria?</h2>
                    
                    <div id="graphStrep"></div>
                    
                    <p>When considering how to display the relationship between the gram staining property and MIC of Streptomycin for different types of bacteria, there are multiple considerations to be taken into account, such as graph or chart type, axis placement, color, labels, and much more. As evidenced by my graph, I put MIC of Streptomycin on the y-axis and the bacteria strains on the x-axis. While making this decision, I had to take into account the visual encoding of position. In the case where numbers are growing vertically instead of horizontally, there is more of an impression of growth, as the eye is trained to look for growth vertically before looking horizontally. </p>

                    <p>I also chose to place the bacteria type on the bottom, with the labels reading directly down from where the data point is placed. This clearly illustrates which data point a label is referring to, as opposed to tilted labels, which can look overwhelming especially in the case where the labels are long. Color-wise, I chose to use two different colors: red for bacteria with negative gram staining, and green for bacteria with positive gram staining. I chose red for negative, as red is typically associated with negative things such as danger, while green is associated with more positive things, e.g. a green light allowing traffic to move ahead. </p>


                    <p>Lastly, I also chose to place labels above each of the data points in order to allow people to interpret the data with the utmost accuracy. Even though people tend to be good at judging position on a graph, I placed labels of the exact MIC of Streptomycin for each bacteria type in order to avoid any confusion.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How does the MIC of Streptomycin compare to the MIC of Neomycin for negative gram staining bacteria types?</h2>
                    
                    <div id="graphMIC"></div>

                    <p>In order to appropriately show the relationship between negative gram staining bacteria and the MIC of streptomycin and Neomycin, I first considered what type of graph would communicate this data best. I settled on a grouped bar chart, as this format would help draw attention to the comparison between the two MIC values of each antibiotic.</p>

                    <p>The primary way bar charts visually encode data is length, which can be easily communicated when presented vertically or horizontally, however, I decided to place the bacteria types on the y-axis for this chart, to allow the bacteria type labels to be read upright, which should allow for easier interpretation. While the two colors are arbitrary and do not necessarily mean anything, I made sure to chose drastically different colors which also show up well on the screen. This allows for better visibility and eliminates the possibility of the two bars getting mixed up.</p>

                    <p>I decided not to include labels, as they ended up adding a lot of distracting clutter. Additionally, the scale is fairly small, making it easier to determine where each bar hits. Thus, I concluded that not only would labels just add unnecessary clutter, they were also not needed. </p>
